# Competitive Programming

This repository contains some of the competitive programming problems that I've solved in Codeforces and LeetCode. It may also have some exercises from other sources.

<h4>     
Disclaimer: these codes do not follow any clean code principle, thus they DO NOT represent my programming habits. The goal in competitive programming is to write codes that solve the problems with the minimal time complexity and in the shortest time possible. Therefore, variable names might be short and not meaningful, codes might lack comments etc.
